        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Tapestry is a STEM support group for young women who are underrepresented and in minority communities.
            <br> <br> The vision is to focus on mental health by creating a positive virtual community. <br> <br>
            We found that there are tons of resources to learn and gain new skills in tech, but there is a big gap between
           learning and how it can affect our mental health. <br> <br> More and more young females are not pursuing a path or worse even 
            dropping out of their major because of imposter syndrome. <br> <br> At Tapestry, we want to enhance the experience to those
            on the college or bootcamp path by lending a hand of support - mental support that is. <br> <br> Just like the name, this
           group will come together.</p>

    <div id ="section3">
        <h1>Mission</h1>
        <img src="Untitled_Artwork(6).JPEG"  width="550" height="500" align="center">
        <img src="Untitled_Artwork (3).JPEG"  width="450" height="500" align="right">
        <p> The idea behind Tapestry is to partner with college/universities along with coding bootcamps to better connect 
        with students. <br> <br> Our approach is zoning in on mental health practices such as cognitive therapy. <br> <br>
        By joining, young women will get the chance to meet, engage, and express emotions on their STEM journey. <br> <br>
        The virtual group will not only form as a sharing circle, but also host fun events that improves mental health. <br> <br>
